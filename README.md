This repo is for course Computer Vision, include 2 main things:

- Research project: 
	- DeepFaceLab: https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab
- CNN-related project: MNIST and Fashion-MNIST:
	- load, preprocess full MNIST and Fashion-MNIST data with 64000 data point
	- training with some following model 
		- seft-architect CNN (609k parameters)
		- LeNet (369k parameters)
		- AlexNet (78m parameters)
	- each model is self-build from tensorflow-keras
	- evalution and comparision each model after training
